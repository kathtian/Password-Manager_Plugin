This code is for a custom password manager that encrypts/decrypts any username and password form submission for users using the Chrome browser. We aim to maximize user experience by triggering the plugin in the event of a password submission, and thereafter the user will be able to confirm or deny the storage of the password in our plugin. We ensure security of password storage by encrypting the data before sending it off to our database so that our system will never know the contents of the userâ€™s sensitive information. When a user revisits a website that is stored in our database, we will pull and decrypt the username/password from the database and autofill the input fields with their respective information.
